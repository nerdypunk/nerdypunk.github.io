Here you will find all the info from the development of my game **Spaceman Memories**.  
If you want to wishlist or follow the game on social media find more info at [www.nerdypunk.dev](http://www.nerdypunk.dev).  
This work is inspired by the .plan files by John Carmack which he posted in the early ID Software days.  
I hope to use this as an accountability system for my game development endeavors. If you want  
to make your own archive, just fork [this repo on Github](https://github.com/nerdypunk/nerdypunk.github.io).
